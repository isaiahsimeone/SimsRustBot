# Sim's Rust Bot

Not working on this anymore

Currently supports:
- Two way messaging from web browser and in-game
- All (as of early 2024) game events are published over a bus for easy service integration
- Full web browser map implementation with game chat and live map markers
- FCM device integration
- other stuff
