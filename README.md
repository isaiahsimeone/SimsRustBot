Next:
- ~~Chinook blades~~
- Death markers
- GetSteamPic() function. Call from JS
- set min marker size for zoom in - they get too small
- Team chat -> web interface
- Player list in web interface
- Shop UI browser in web interface
- grouping vending machines on map
- browser shop search - snap to shop
- browser map control - snap to player
- map grid
- refactor
- we can tell when heli goes down if it vanishes within the map
- we can get oil crate by chinook?
- make map bigger to fit oil - we can add img of rig to map before saivg as map.jpg

Soon/maybe
- Marker extrapolation (player, chinook, cargo, heli)
- When heli/cargo comes in, give player compass bearing to its entry point
- Consider takig the map image, and expanding thhe sides to make it the same as game map, math is already workig, but we i don't thhhik we can curretly plot oil etc
- alert new shops? option
